## The Kinchin-Pease model

The Kinchin-Pease (K-P) model is a simplifed estimate of the number of displaced atoms ($Nd$) per PKA by means of the simple set of proposed relationships:



test this $\mathcal{N}(0,\,1)$ right now

let's see if this works <tex>$N_d$<tex> for now

Where $E$ is the energy of the PKA and $E_d$ is the threshold energy. As energies above $E_i$, the recoils lose energy only by electron excitation, while below $E_i$ the energy transfer and loss is controlled by hardsphere elastic interactions (e.g. scattering). Note, the simplified model does not account for the effects due to the crystal lattice (e.g. crystal strucutre effects) for either single interactions or more complex damage cascades.

## The charge of a neutron

Based on the K-P model, if an energetic particle has an energy less than $E_d$ then what happens to the struck atom?

> $E_d$ is the energy required to displace an atom

- [ ] The struck atom is displaced from the lattice site and is presumed to come to rest at a location in the lattice different from it's previous position
- [x] The struck atom is presumed to resume to it's lattice site after the interaction

Understanding the charge of a neutron is critical to capturing the interaction physics between a neutron with a given motion (e.g. energy) and a neutron at rest (e.g. the core of atom in a lattice)
