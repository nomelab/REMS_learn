The equilibrium radius of a precipitate under irradiation was given in class as:
$$r_{eq}^3=\frac{3}{4 \pi N_p}\left(\frac{x_s}{C_p}-\frac{k \mu}{4}(1-x_s)\frac{r_{eq}}{D_s}\right)$$<p>
or as (note corrections from lecture slides), 
$$r_{eq}=\frac{B}{3u}-u$$
where
$$u=\left(\frac{-C}{2}+\sqrt{\frac{C^2}{4}+\frac{B^3}{27}}\right)^{(1/3)}$$
and
$$B=\frac{3}{4\pi N_p}\frac{K_o \mu (1-x_s)}{4 D_S};~~~~~C=\frac{3}{4 \pi N_p}\frac{x_s}{C_p}$$<p>
- Consider a Fe-5%Cr alloy with Cr-rich $\alpha'$ precipitates where $C_{\alpha'}=0.66Cr$. What happens to the solute if not in the presence of irradiation, $K_0=0$?

shuffle_answers: false

What is the charge of a neutron?

> The charge is based on the electrical properties of the neutron

- [ ] positive
- [ ] negative
- [x] neutral

{{% notice note %}}
Understanding the charge of a neutron is critical to capturing the interaction physics between a neutron with a given motion (e.g. energy) and a neutron at rest (e.g. the core of atom in a lattice)
