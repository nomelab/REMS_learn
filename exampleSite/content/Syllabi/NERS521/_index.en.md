|**Lecture Hours**|Monday: 10:30 am - 12:00 pm <br /> Wednesday: 10:30 am - 12:00 pm|
|**Lecture Location**|[CSRB 2238](https://campusinfo.umich.edu/building-search/building/142/climate-and-space-research-building-csrb)|
|**Office Hours**|TBD|
|**Readings**|We will use a variaty of text and manuscripts to assist with learning, plus the REMS website. The primary source material is from the two following textbooks with online resources:  <ol><li>G.S. Was, [Fundamentals of Radiation Materials Science: Metals and Alloys](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-3438-6), Second Edition, Springer, New York, 2017.</li><li> D.R. Olander, [Fundamentals Aspects of Nuclear Reactor Fuel Elements](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015095162049&view=1up&seq=7), TID-26711-P1, USERDA, Washington DC, 1976.</li></ol> |
|**Outcomes**|<ul><li> Provide an in-depth description and analysis of energetic particle interactions<li> Calculate the damage imparted to a crystal from energetic particle bombardments<li> Explain point-defect production and mobility as it relates to radiation damage<li> Identify key radiation damage produced 1D, 2D and 3D microstructures and the associated mechanisms as a function of dose, dose rate, and temperature</ul>|
|**Materials**|Course lecture notes are available on the REMS website|
|**Activities**|The majority of the class meetings will consist of lectures with homework assigned for out of classroom learning and development. Practice problems and study guides for each homework and exam are provided on the REMS website|
|**Attendance**|Official attendance is not taken, but you are strongly encouraged to attend lectures as it is easy to get behind in the course content. If you miss a class because of sickness, emergency, research conference, etc. please let me know and I will travel to provide additional materials (e.g. previous recorded course lectrues) to make sure you stay current in the class.|
|**Grading**|40% Homework <br />30% Midterm exam <br />30% Final exam|
|**Late Assignment Policy**|<24 hrs: 75%; <48 hrs: 50%, >48 hrs: 25%.|
|**Letter Grade Assignment**|>95% A+, >90% A, >85% A-, >80% B+, >75% B, >70% B-, >65 D+|
|**Honor Code Statement**|It is expected all material and submitted assignments will be your own, original work. For the case of homework assignments, group study and discussion are acceptable and encouraged, but the submitted assignments must have been completed in full by yourself. Exams should be taken independently. At the time of the exam, the use of outside material will be discussed. Any evidence of non-original work or co-dependent exam completion will be considered a possible Honor Code violation and be reported to the Honor Council.|
|**Students with Disabilities**|We are available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required for student with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations are to be made during the first three weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances. Students are encouraged to register with Office of Students with Disabilities, G-664 Haven Hall, 763-3000, http://ssd.umich.edu/ to verify their eligibility for appropriate accommodations.|
|**Diversity Statement**|All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability â€“and other visible and nonvisible differences.|
|**Student Resources**|If you require additional resources please contact the Office of Student Support and Accountability, ossa.engin.umich.edu or engin-support@umich.edu. In addition, if you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via caps.umich.edu/mitalk|

### Lecture Schedule

*Please note this schedule is tentative*

The course is divided into three main components based on the general events associated with a radiation effects. These are: (i) The radiation damage event, (ii) Point defect generation, recombination and mobility, and (III) the formation of extended defects. Each section schedule is provided below:

#### Part I: The radiation damage event
*Objective:* Develop a fundamental understanding of the physics of the radiation damage event
